# alertView
MBManager is based on 'MBProgressHUD'.It is disgned to use MB more easily for us developers in our project.
All the methods are checked in my project. So please be easy in your mind to jion in 'MBManager'.

Usage:
    To use it is very easy. You just need to import 'MBManager' and 'MBProgressHUD'.And in the place where you need to use just invoke one of the methods you need.For instance "[MBManager showLoading];".And to dismiss it with "[MBManager hideAlert];". It is convenient, isn't it?
Hope you enjoy it. And any quetion,you can contact with me.
